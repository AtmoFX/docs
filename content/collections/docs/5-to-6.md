## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. While there are many items on this page, a majority of them only apply to addons or custom code. We've noted who each item would apply to so you can more easily scan through the changes.

### Upgrade using Composer

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "^5.0" // [tl!--]
"statamic/cms": "^6.0" // [tl!++]
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

### PHP and Laravel support
**Affects apps using PHP < 8.2 or Laravel < 11.**

- The minimum version of PHP is now 8.2.
- The minimum version of Laravel is now 11.

We highly recommend upgrading all the way to Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4.

:::tip
If you want to (semi-)automate the Laravel upgrade process, we recommend using [Laravel Shift](https://laravelshift.com/discounts/statamic-1983) (use that link for a special 19.83% discount ðŸ¤˜).
:::

### Vue 3
**Affects apps or addons that use Vue.**

We have upgraded the Control Panel's version of Vue.js from 2 to 3.

To keep this upgrade guide manageable, we have a [dedicated page for upgrading from Vue 2 to Vue 3](/upgrade-guide/vue-2-to-3).

If you do not have any custom Vue components in your app, or in your own addons, you can skip this.

## Medium impact changes

### Carbon 3

Support for [Carbon 2.x](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/) has been removed. All Statamic 6 sites now require [Carbon 3.x](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-carbon-3).

If you're using any of Statamic's `months_ago`, `weeks_ago`, `days_ago`, `hours_ago`, `minutes_ago`, and `seconds_ago` modifiers, you will notice that they now return floats instead of integers. Comparing against past timestamps will also result in negative numbers.

You _may_ need to updates your templates to account for these changes.
